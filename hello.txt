--- Things to note ---

Commit = record changes locally (In VSCode)
Push   = send local commits to GitHub
Pull   = bring changes from GitHub back into local repo

- Always save files before committing.
- If VSCode warns about conflicts -- VSCode gives buttons to 
  accept Current/Incoming/Both -- use them.
- If feeling lost, use 'git status' to tell exactly what Git 
  expects next. Use it often

git add hello.txt
git commit -m "message"
git push
